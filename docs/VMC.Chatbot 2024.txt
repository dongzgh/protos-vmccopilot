VMC.Chatbot (Virtual Software Assitant)

Problems:
- Nobody has enough time to read tons of help documentations
- Nobody has good memories about everything of our product
- Even experience users have hard time to find information about a specific functionality
- We don't have call centers and menpowers 24 hours 7 days

Opportunities:
- LLM has been developed to a quite mature state
- Performance of cloud service providers has been improved a lot
- AI engines are already integrated with cloud services

Ideas:
- To develop a AI (LLM) based chatbot as a virtual software assitant for our products

Benetifs:
- Reduce the workload of supporting engineers answering naiive questions
- Enable engineers to focus more on maintaining and enhancingthe knowledge database
- Self-hosted and curated knowledge database to better serve our users in specific vertical markets
- A more natural interactive experice to users (Command->GUI->Scripts->Chat)

Future - VMC.Copilot:
- No need for users to find the use of a specific functionality, just ask and we will show it
- No need for users to find a specific GUI item, just ask and we will show it
- No need for users to write a script, just ask and we will generate it
- No need for users to ask Google or ChatGPT to understand scientific jargons, just ask and we will explain it

First Step:
- Build self-curated knowledge database for that VMC product's specifc vertical market
- Develop a general chatbot for one (or more) of VMC products
- Find some good examples to showcase the experiments
