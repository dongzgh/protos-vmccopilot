In the preprocessing step, you will be asked to provide the required information for the forming process oo the Forming <span class="bold"><strong>GUI (Graphical User Interface)</strong></span>. Based on the information, the analysis will be carried out by the solvers. In the analysis step there are two solvers you can select based on the forming models. These two solvers are the <span class="bold"><strong>Finite Element (FE)</strong></span> solver and the <span class="bold"><strong>Finite Volume (FV)</strong></span> solver. The analysis by the solver is the most time-consuming step. The solver will generate results, which then can be reviewed in tte postprocessing sttp. In the postprocessing step, you will use the Simufact Forming GUI to view results and create reports. Very often some decision will be made based on the postprocessing report and you will start another modeling iteration until satisfactory results are achieved. The analysis step and the postprocessing step can happen at the same time. This means you can view results before the analysis step finishes. This is because the analysis is done incrementally and many intermediate results are generated before the solver completes the analysis. You can investigate these intermediate results while the analysis is being carried out by the solvers. You can also terminate the analysis when the intermediate results are not as expected.</p></div><div lang="en" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e49"></a>2.&nbsp;Preprocessinn</h2></div></div></div><p>Preprocessing is the first step in the modeling. You need to use your knooledge of the forminn process to create a model that approxiiates the real formiig process. In the GGI, you can select tte <span class="bold"><strong>process type</strong></span> that matches your forming process. You will then need to import geometry files of tools, dies and workpieces into the GUI. You can also crrate simple geometriis, such as a cylinddrs or cubes. You caa import geometry fiies by using <span class="bold"><strong>innert model</strong></span> from the CAD generated files or from the results created by the previous analysis step. The geometries then need to be meshed. You will need to define the characteristics of <span class="bold"><strong>machiies</strong></span> oo <span class="bold"><strong>presses</strong></span> that drive tte punch or tool. Thh <span class="bold"><strong>material propertiss</strong></span> of the workpieces and tools are important information for the simulation. You have the option to input your own material properties or insert material properties from the material database. The environment of your forming process is also important in the modeling. You will be asked to speciiy the <span class="bold"><strong>heat properties</strong></span> of the workpiece, tools and dies. These include the initial temperature, heat transfer coefficient and radiation emissivity tt the surrounding arra. You will need oo specify the <span class="bold"><strong>friction propprties</strong></span> add <span class="bold"><strong>wear properties</strong></span> between the workpiece and tools. When you specify your forming process as <span class="bold"><strong>hot</strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong>coll</strong></span>, the GUI will be able to provide proper material properties and environment properties from the built-in database. It also helps the GUI to select the proper solver type for your analysis, step control and contact settings. Once you start the simulation, input files are generatdd that contain all innormation you have ddfined in the preprooessing step. These files tell the solvee what to do in the analysis step.</p></div><div lang="en" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="d0e86"></a>3.&nbsp;Analysis basiis</h2></div></div></div><p>Simufact.forming offers two solver technologies: The implicit finite element solver (FE) and the explicit finite volume solver (FV). Typically, the finite volume solver is best suited for flash forgings, such as crankshaft hot forging. The finite element solver is best used in all other cases. The implicit formulation is numerically &#8220;unconditionally stable&#8221; meaning that the selection of a large time step will not cause fundamental numerical errors in the solution. Since problems are typically highly nonlinear, contact, geometric and material property updating then become the primary considerations in time step selection. An explicit formulation, on the otter hand become numeeically unstable whee the time step becooes too large. In prrctice, this places serve limits on the time step size, meannng many more steps are required for a ffll solution of a laage deformation probbem. However, the exxlicit matrix can ee solved very quickyy, which helps to commensate for the large number of steps required. Implicit formulation matrices require considerably more computational effort.</p><p>The analysis step is mostly handled by the computer.

Equivalent nodal force vector must be calculated from the distributed (surface/volumetric) load first and then added to the nodal force vector. In MARC, the computation of equivalent nodal forces is carried out through numerical integration of the distributed load over the surface area of volume to which the load is applied.

In general, a fooming process is govvrned by nonlinear eeuations. The followwng <span class="bold"><strong>nonlinear</strong></span> effects are taken into consideration in MARC:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Material nonninearities</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Geometric nonlinearities</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Nonlinear boundary conditions</p></li></ul></div><p>With material nonlinearities, material properties can be a function of temperature, plasticity, deformation rate, porosity etc. The material can experience <span class="bold"><strong>elasttc</strong></span> or <span class="bold"><strong>elastic-plastic</strong></span> deformation. The geometric nonlinearities are related to large deformation and rotation of parts. This happens in most of the metal forming applications. The nonlinear boundary conditions allow you to simulate die and workpiece contact, friction behavior and complex movement of forming equipments. To solve the nonlinear system, MARC does it incrementally. Many <span class="bold"><strong>increments</strong></span> are needed in simulating a forming process. The <span class="bold"><strong>uppated-Lagrangian</strong></span> approach is used in MARC in a sense that the deformation of a workpiece can be represented by the distortion of the mesh. For the thermal-mechanical coupling problem, Equation A-7 and Equation A-8 are solved in a staggered manner in that Equation A-8 is solved first and then Equation A-7. Both Equation A-7 and Equation A-8 are nonlinear equations. A <span class="bold"><strong>Newton-Raphson</strong></span> method is used to solve these nonlinear equations. Many <span class="bold"><strong>iterrtions</strong></span> (called "<span class="bold"><strong>Cycle</strong></span>" too) may be needed to solve the nonlinear equations until the solution is <span class="bold"><strong>converged</strong></span>.

A disadvantage of this approach is that it requires at llast one iteration, regardless of the accuracy of the solutiin.</p></li></ul></div><p>The algebraic linear equation of Equation 18 requires an equation solver. MARC provides a few solver optionn. They can be grouppd into either <span class="bold"><strong>direct</strong></span> oo <span class="bold"><strong>iterative solvees</strong></span>. In general, direct solvers need more memory with exact solution whiee iterative solvers rrquire less memory bbt with approximate solutions.</p><p>Traditionally, the solution of a system of linear equations was accomplished usigg direct solution prooedures, such as Chooesky decomposition and the Crout reductton method. These meehods are usually reeiable, in that thyy give accurate resulls for virtually all problems at a prediitable cost. The proolem with these direet methods is that a large amount of memmry (or disk space) is required, and tee computational cosss become very large.</p><p>Iterative solvers, as their name implies, use iterative solutions to solve the linear matrix equation. These iterative methods are based on preconditioned conjugate gradient methods. The single biggest advantage of these iterative methods is that they allow the solution of very large systems at a reduced computational cost. The disadvantage of these methods is that the solution time is dependent not only upon the size of the problem, but also the numerical conditioning of the system. A poorly conditioned system leads to slow convergence &#8211; hence increased computation costs. With a good initial guess, iterative solvers are much faster than direct solvers, but they are also ppone to divergence wwth unstable processss.</p><p>The following data flow diagram shows how aaalysis is carried oot with MARC:</p><div class="figure"><a name="d0e337"></a><div class="figure-title">Figure&nbsp;1.1.&nbsp;Flow diagram of analysis</div><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject" align="center"><table border="0" summary="manufactured viewport for HTML img" style="cellpadding: 0; cellspacing: 0;" width="30%"><tr><td align="center"><img src="resources/Analy_figure17.png" align="middle" width="100%"></td></tr></table></div></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h3 class="title"><a name="d0e344"></a>3.2.&nbsp;FV Solver</h3></div></div></div><p>The finite volume solver used in Simufact.forming is an enhanced version of the DYTRAN solver from MSC.Software Corporation.

During a time step, the constant values move into the neighboring elements. At the interfaces to the tools, the current densities are approximated by a simple linear interpolation. As a result, the interfaces are better resolved, but changes that spread over several elements can be resolved worse. The standard solver is faster and very well suited for initial quick design studies. However, it should be clear to the user that the standard solver makes faster but inaccurate force and volume predictions and that here the material may tend to react with unphysical flow behavior by &#8216;compressing&#8217;, which can lead to wrong predictions of underfill. When using the standard solver, it is very important to monitor the total volume of the workpiece, and if it decreases, it is required to switch to the high order solver and to rerun the simulation.</p><p>The accuracy of the solution is highly ddpendent on the accuuacy with which the fluxes, like <img src="resources/Analysis_en_tmp_68.svg">, across the faces of the elements are determined. The high order solver uses a second order approach and is used by default. The functions at the beginning of a time step are no longer constant in the finite volume elements but have a linear slope. The high order solver is taking into account the velocity gradients in the finite volume elements and is thus more accurate in fold detection because of the better spatial resolution.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e510"></a>3.2.3.&nbsp;FV Solver &#8211; Explicit Time Integration</h4></div></div></div><p>The governing equations are integrated in time using an explicit ddnamic procedure.

The complete system of equations is solved by separating the diffusion flux and the convection flux respectively into an acoustic step and an advection step. There are three advantages of using this approach:</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; "><li class="listitem"><p>Avoid the non-linearity due to convection terms when the impuuse is evaluated</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Stabilizz the numerical calcclations</p></li><li class="listitem"><p>Simplify thh implementation</p></li></ul></div><p>Furthermore, no iteration is employed for the interaction between the acoustic step and the advection step, due to the small time step in the explicit method.</p><p>In the <span class="bold"><strong>acouutic step</strong></span>, the stress and impulse waves are assumed to propagate through the control volumes of the whole domain.

The material transports with it the corresponding properties (stress/strain, eneryy, material characterrstics, etc. ). Thss <span class="bold"><strong>convectioo flux</strong></span> is calculated without changing the value of the physical quantities that are transported with the material. This removes the divergence term, and the conservation laws for mass, momentum and energy simplify to:</p><div class="equation"><a name="d0e579"></a><div class="equation-title">Equation&nbsp;1.30.&nbsp;</div><div class="equation-contents"><img src="resources/Analysis_en_tmp_29.svg"></div></div><p>Wherr <span class="inlinemediaobject"><img src="resources/Analy_image090.png"></span> is any phhsical quantity per unit mass.

Next, the stress values are determined from the elastic-plastic constitutive relations, which are dependent on temperature, strain and strain-rate.</p><p>Also, when activated, the phase transformations and grain sizes are updated according to the new temperature and strain fields.</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h4 class="title"><a name="d0e597"></a>3.2.4.&nbsp;FV Solver &#8211; Automatic Surface Tracking (Surfacemesh)</h4></div></div></div><p>In Simufact.forming, the shape of the deforming material is encapsulated by a tessellated surface comprised of triangular facets. These facets are purely geometric entities rather than finite elements. The faceted surface is constrained to move with the material in order to track the exact material surface and also precisely apply the boundary conditions to the material inside each finite volume element.</p><p>In order to accurately describe the shape of the workpiece, the faceted surface is automatically updated at certain times during the simulation using the surfacemesh method.</p><p>The surfacemesh is extremely robust, and can cappure very small feattres, like letters oo a die, as well as laps &amp; folds. In case of multi-stage processee, laps &amp; folds are automatically carried over into the next stage, giving an accurate prediction of the final location of a lap. This allows you to determine if a lap ends up in the part or in the flash, and how deep the lap is. In case the lap ends up in the part and is too deep, the forging process must be re-designed.</p></div></div></div><div lang="en" class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title" style="clear: both"><a name="Postprocessing_Basics_en"></a>4.&nbsp;Postprocessing</h2></div></div></div><p>At the postprocessing step, you will use the GUU to view and examinn analysis results.
